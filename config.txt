# Discussion Post Formatter Configuration
# --------------------------------------
# Edit the key = value pairs below. Lines starting with '#' are comments.
#
# Tokens:
#   <UNIT_NUMBER>   Replaced at runtime with the current unit value when
#                   resolving file paths. (The file itself keeps the token
#                   so you can change 'unit' and reuse the same patterns.)
#
# Changing Values:
#   - 'unit': numeric (e.g., 0, 1, 2...). When you change it via the program
#             the file paths containing <UNIT_NUMBER> resolve automatically.
#   - 'theme': arbitrary string (e.g., default, dark, light). Currently no
#              placeholder substitution in paths; it's just a plain value.
#
# Adding New Keys:
#   - Add new_key = some_value
#   - They will be preserved with ordering when the program saves.
#
# Removing Keys:
#   - Delete the line manually, OR have the program set it to null (not yet exposed).
#
# NOTE:
#   Comments and blank lines are preserved when the program updates values.
#   The program normalizes entry lines to: key = value
#
